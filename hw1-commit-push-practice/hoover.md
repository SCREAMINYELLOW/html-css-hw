<h1> This is a heading </h1>
<p>Look, now I've created a paragraph under my heading. I will continue now, and insert and image of a cute dog: <img src=https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/17/30/pembroke-welsh-corgi.jpg> Isn't he adorable?!?! </p>
<p>Now I've started a new paragraph. Sorry this is so long, in my <strong> Writing and Digital Media </strong> we used <em>Atom</em>, so I'm working on getting used to <u>Visual Studio Code</u>.</p>
<p>I also took that class in the Fall 2019 semester, and honestly <del>that feels like it happened forever ago.</del></p>
